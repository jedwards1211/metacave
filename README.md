# metacave
## One cave survey data format to rule them all

**(In progress!)**

Metacave is a [JSON](http://json.org/) cave survey data format.  That means it's:
* Way easier to parse, interpret, or output than any other formats out there
* Primarily designed for programs to work with, but not that hard for humans
  to read and edit
* Extensible!
  * You can add all the metadata you want to any shot, station, trip, or cave,
    and give it a nice structure
  * You can embed program-specific features in it, without ruining another
    program's ability to load the base survey data
* Easy to store in MongoDB

Metacave will soon become the native format (with extensions) for 
[Breakout](http://helloandy.xyz/breakout) and probably also [Cavewhere](https://github.com/Cavewhere/cavewhere).

In addition, Andy (author of Breakout) has import/export for Walls `.srv` files nearly
finished, and will have import/export for Compass `.dat` files soon as well (a much easier
job than parsing `.srv` files!

                                            Default unit: "fsAzmUnit", then "angleUnit"

              "bsAzm": 22.5                 Optional angle - the backsight azimuth
                                            Default unit: "bsAzmUnit", then "angleUnit"

                                            At least one of "fsInc" and "bsInc" is
                                            required unless the from and to stations
                                            have "depth"s

              "fsInc": -5                   Optional angle - the frontsight inclination
                                            Default unit: "fsIncUnit", then "angleUnit"

                                            shot's dist from the total length of the cave,
                                            false (or omitted) otherwise

            {                               The survey must end with a station
              "station": "END"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    "Mammoth Cave": {                       Everything inside here is for Mammoth Cave
      ...
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

### Splay shots

If the to station of a shot is null, or has no "station" property, the shot is considered
a splay shot.

Examples:

```
  "survey": [
    {"station": "A1"},
    {"dist": 55, "fsAzm": 23, "fsInc": 80}, This is a splay shot from A1
    {},                                     station placeholder
    {},                                     shot placeholder
    {"station": "A1"},
    {"dist": 45, "fsAzm": 32, "fsInc": 75}, Another splay shot from A1
    null,                                   station placeholder
    null,                                   shot placeholder
    {"station": "A2"},
    {"dist": 32, "fsAzm": 64, "fsInc": 32}, A splay shot from A2
    {"hello": "world},                      Because this station has no "station" property
                                            it's equivalent to null
  ]
```

Example JavaScript interpreting logic:

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < survey.length - 2; i += 2) {
  var from = survey[i],
      shot = survey[i + 1],
      to   = survey[i + 2];

  if (shot && (shot.dist || shot.dist === 0)) {
    if (!from || !from.station) {
      throw new Error("missing from station");
    }
    if (to && to.station) {
      // handle as splay shot
    }
    else {
      // handle as regular shot
    }
  }
}
```

### Individual unit overrides

Anywhere (_anywhere_!) you put a quantity with default units, you can instead override the default unit
by entering an array like this:

```
  "dist": [4, "m"]                          distance is 4 meters even if "distUnit": "ft"

  "dist": [5, "ft", 7, "in"]                distance is 5 feet 7 inches

  "dist": [4, "in", 6, "ft", 2, "m"]        distance is 4 inches + 6 feet + 2 meters
                                            this is absurd, but programs will be simpler
                                            if they don't have to worry about weird order
                                            or combined unit systems

  "azmFsCorrection": [2, "grad"]            frontsight azimuth correction is 2 gradians

  "lat":  [23, "deg", 26, "min", 21, "sec"] 23° 26′ 21″ (the Tropic of Cancer)

  "lrud": [4, 5, 1, [5, "in"]]              left, right, and up are in default units,
                                            down is 5 inches
```

### Can I use [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/)?

Great question!  Metacave would certainly look nicer to non-programmers if it were in YAML, right?

Plus, associating metadata like passage and area names with arbitrary groups of stations can be done more efficiently using YAML references.

**So feel free to make your program support YAML!**

#### BUT

* Please don't use any YAML features that can't be converted to JSON
* Please for the love of god don't use it like this:
```
%YAML 1.2
---
!!map {
  ? !!str "sequence"
  : !!seq [ !!str "one", !!str "two" ],
  ? !!str "mapping"
  : !!map {
    ? !!str "sky" : !!str "blue",
    ? !!str "sea" : !!str "green",
  },
}
```
The authors of YAML really got carried away, didn't they?

### Embedding Metadata

You can add any additional properties you want to JSON objects (the things enclosed in `{ }`).

Programs can ignore additional properties if they want, or visualize them somehow, or allow you
to search for shots by metadata, etc.

At the extreme end, programs can embed highly program-specific data - for example Philip Schuhardt
and I are working on a way of embedding Cavewhere's scanned note warping data.

The beauty of JSON's flexibility is that other programs will still be able to read all of the core
survey data without conversion, even if they don't know how to interpret another program's specific data.

If two programs embed data that has almost the same format but not quite, they might confuse each other -
but this can be solved by making an import feature that only interprets the core survey data, and then
making the routine that interprets the program-specific data build off of that.

For example, in Fisher Ridge all trips are assigned a number, so we could note that like so:

```
  "trips": [
    {
      "number": 1,
      ...
    },
    {
      "number": 2,
      ...
    },
    ...
  ]
```

Or say you wanted to note water depth at each station:

```
  "survey": [
    {
      "station": "W1",
      "waterDepth": 2,
      ...
    },
    {
      "dist": 5,
      ...
    },
    {
      "station": W2",
      "waterDepth": 5,
      ...
    },
    ...
  ]
```
